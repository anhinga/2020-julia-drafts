My involvement with Julia: January - March 2020

The starting point was that I discovered the existence of Julia Flux machine learning framework in late January:

February:

I created a file on Julia Flux and Zygote, and possible implementation of DMM in Julia Flux:

Julia is an unusual language. It is based around the idea of 
"eating your cake and having it too, again and again". 
Flexible and very fast at the same time, friendly readable syntax and Lisp-strength macros and multiple dispatch, etc:

Julia Flux is trying to become the next generation machine learning framework, 
and is also characterized by this approach of "eating your cake and having it too". 
If TensorFlow 1.0 is the past, and PyTorch is the leading state-of-the-art framework of the present, 
Julia Flux is quite likely to become the machine learning framework of the future.
