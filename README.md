Julia notes and code drafts

This repository covers January-April 2020.

Then there has been some joint work with a friend on transformation and static and dynamic visualization of images in Julia, mostly in May. This is still uncommitted, I'll include links here when I commit some version of this code.

Then there was JuliaCon 2020 in July: https://juliacon.org/2020/ and it included a remarkable 4-hour tutorial on SciML: https://mobile.twitter.com/ComputingByArts/status/1287501509127811073 and tons of other useful materials.

Then I was using Julia in my explorations of **interpreting monocrome images as matrices** and performing **matrix multiplication** of those matrices and then visualizing the result.

That happened initially in October, and then in December 2020 and January 2021 I started to use **Julia Jupyter notebooks**, see https://github.com/anhinga/julia-notebooks and, in particular, https://github.com/anhinga/julia-notebooks/tree/main/images-as-matrices for some of my experimental results.
