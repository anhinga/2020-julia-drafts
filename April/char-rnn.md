## Exercises wih char-rnn model and its variations

(Data are here: https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/char-rnn/ )

I used to reproduce those results with https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow

We'll focus on generating fake C code, and on training on Linux kernel. I have found in the past that training just on Linux kernel produces results which look good enough (and also it is much easier to evaluate them visually, compared to the natural language text).

```julia
julia> isfile("input.txt")
false

julia> download("https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/char-rnn/linux_input.txt", "input.txt")
"input.txt"

julia> isfile("input.txt")
true
```
