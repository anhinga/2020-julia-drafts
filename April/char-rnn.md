## Exercises wih char-rnn model and its variations

(Data are here: https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/char-rnn/ )

I used to reproduce those results with https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow

We'll focus on generating fake C code, and on training on Linux kernel. I have found in the past that training just on Linux kernel produces results which look good enough (and also it is much easier to evaluate them visually, compared to the natural language text).

```julia
julia> using Flux

julia> isfile("input.txt")
false

julia> download("https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/char-rnn/linux_input.txt", "input.txt")
"input.txt"

julia> isfile("input.txt")
true
```

Processing the text.

```julia
julia> text = collect(String(read("input.txt")))
6206993-element Array{Char,1}:

julia> alphabet = [unique(text)..., '_']
101-element Array{Char,1}:

julia> using Flux: onehot

julia> text = map(ch -> onehot(ch, alphabet), text)  # looking at the full printout here is interesting
6206993-element Array{Flux.OneHotVector,1}:

julia> stop = onehot('_', alphabet)
101-element Flux.OneHotVector:
```

`onehot` is a rather involved implementation-wise (I did not study the details):

https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl/blob/master/src/onehot.jl

But the end result is simple, an array with a single 1 in the right place, and zeros elsewhere.

Let's partition for batching and such now.

```julia
julia> N = length(alphabet)
101

julia> seqlen = 50
50

julia> nbatch = 50
50

julia> using Flux: chunk, batchseq, throttle, crossentropy

julia> using Base.Iterators: partition

julia> Xs = collect(partition(batchseq(chunk(text, nbatch), stop), seqlen))  # large inconvenient printout; might want to suppress
2483-element Array{Array{Flux.OneHotMatrix{Array{Flux.OneHotVector,1}},1},1}:

julia> Ys = collect(partition(batchseq(chunk(text[2:end], nbatch), stop), seqlen))  # same
2483-element Array{Array{Flux.OneHotMatrix{Array{Flux.OneHotVector,1}},1},1}:
```

`chunk` and `batchseq` can be found in
